# Go Importer

## Challenge
Create an simple app in Go that reads an address CSV file (first, last, street address, city, state, zip) and uses Go channels to write records to a database.
Consider validation concerns, duplicate records etc. Report number of records imported successfully, and number of errors.
For extra credit to make a simple AngularJS interface to it.
